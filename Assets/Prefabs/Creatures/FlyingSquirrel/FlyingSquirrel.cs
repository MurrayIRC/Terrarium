	/*
	TODO:
	- Make this.
	- Subtle z rotation shifts on a sine wave, to make it look like it's very slightly lilting.
	- starts at some point far away from the playspace, turns to face the center.
	- moves forward very very slowly
	- once it reaches the opposite end of where it started in terms of distance we can disable it.
	- only appears once every 30 minutes??? something like that.
